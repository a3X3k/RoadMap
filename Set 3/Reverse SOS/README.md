- It's a `Morse Code`.
- But some encryption in Invalid.
- From the challenge name we shall have a guess that we have to `reverse` the `Audio`.
- After [`reversing`](https://github.com/a3X3k/RoadMap/blob/main/Set%203/Reverse%20SOS/SOS%20-%20Rev.mp3) we shall analyse it.

- After [`decoding`](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) we shall get the `flag`.
