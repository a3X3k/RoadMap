# Some Noise

- Download the [`Audio`](https://github.com/a3X3k/RoadMap/blob/main/Set%202/Root%20Me/Some%20Noise/1.wav) file.
- Analyse using `Audacity`.

### [`Analysis`](https://github.com/a3X3k/RoadMap/blob/main/Set%202/Root%20Me/Some%20Noise/Initial%20Analysis.mp3)

- The `playback speed` is too `high`.
- So lets `reduce` the speed.

- Now the speed is fine.
- But the `lyrics` is not `recognizible`.
- So let's try to reverse it now.
- We may or may not get anything even if we reverse.
- But let's try to do it.

- Now if we play the `audio`, we shall hear the numbers and text.
- This is where the audio should be listened carefully.
- Initially I got `3b27641fc580`.
- But this is not the flag.
- Some texts look like texts, but it's actually `Numbers`.
- Reference is in [`YouTube`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0nUaCyj1G8).

- After refering this I understood that `H --> eit ( 8 )`.
