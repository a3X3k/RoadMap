# Your Old friend Orloge Simard

- We are provided with the [`Audio`](https://github.com/a3X3k/RoadMap/blob/main/Set%201/RingZer0/Your%20Old%20Friend%20Orloge%20Simard/1.mp3) file.
- Analysing it through `Sonic Visualiser` and `Audacity` shows something suspicious.

- On getting close to it, I understood that its a `Morse Code`.

- I `trimmed` the required portion and tried to [`decode`](https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html) the `Morse mp3`.
- But I got only some random texts.
- Then I `manually decoded` it.

- Initially Decoding the first your characters gives `EVMN`.
- The 5th Character `---.` is not in the Morse Code. 
- But we have the reverse of it `.---` which corresponds to `J` in Morse Code.
- So Now I tried to decode the Morse Code in Reverse.

- This Analysis gives us the `flag`.
